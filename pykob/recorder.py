Recorder class

Records wire and local station information for analysis and playback.
Plays back recorded information.

The information is recorded in packets in a JSON structure that includes:
1. Timestamp
2. Source (`local`/`wire`)
3. Station ID
4. Wire Number
5. Code type
6. Code Sequence (key timing information)

Though the name of the class is `recorder` it is typical that a 'recorder' can also 
play back. For example, a 'tape recorder', a 'video casset recorder (VCR)', 
a 'digital video recorder' (DVR), etc. can all play back what they (and compatible 
devices) have recorded. This class is no exception. It provides methods to play back 
recordings in addition to making recordings.
